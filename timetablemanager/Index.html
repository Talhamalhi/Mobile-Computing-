        <p>Timetable manager is an app that allows students to manage their school/university life efficiently. The app allows users to save timetables and school-related tasks and events such as homework or assignments, classes, exams, etc. and access them through mobile devices. The main goal is to notify students whenever they have a scheduled class. Students can save their timings of classes in the app. It will help them to be more productive because manual timetables are difficult to remember, and students often miss their important classes. Another important feature of this app is that students can save an event on a specific date, and it will also be notified to them. The event can be anything like an assignment submission deadline or any other event being help at their institution...</p>
